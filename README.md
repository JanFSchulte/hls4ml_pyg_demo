## hls4ml_pyg_demo
Walkthrough of current progress of hls4ml pyg for tau3mu CMS experiment

## Installation
We need to setup a conda environment to install all the necessary packages. To install the conda environment, first go to this project's root directory and do: <br />

```console
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate pyg_to_hls_walkthrough
```
<br />

This will take some time to run, but at the end of the end of the day. We should see "(pyg_to_hls_walkthrough)" on the left side of our terminal. This shows that we are in that coding environment.

<br />

## Running the walkthrough
The actual walkthrough is on pyg_to_hls_walkthrough.ipynb. To open it, we first need to open jupyter notebook. To do that, we write in our conda pyg_to_hls_walkthrough terminal:

```console
$ jupyter notebook
```

This should automatically open a browser where you can click "pyg_to_hls_walkthrough.ipynb" to open it. <br />
If it doesn't automatically open, the terminal should print out a link for us to copy and paste onto a browser of our choice just like pasting a url of a website. <br />
When you have opened the notebook, please follow the instructions there. Thank you!
